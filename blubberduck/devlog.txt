setup movement for map using arrow keys

kellyW -- 2018-01-02 13:15
added base template, fixed map loading, issue with title and head

naotakaK -- 2018-01-02 13:15
changed map center to times square and added random point generation for heatmap; still needs to be tweaked

michaelR -- 2018-01-03 13:06
fixed base template to properly map onto branching templates -- blocks head and title removed, only content is necessary for any other templates; index template no longer uses head/title blocks

naotakaK -- 2018-01-03 13:12
More work with the map - need to implement
Random spawning of points based on player location
Associate points in heatmap with % chance of encountering pokemon, and scale to the size of that patch of grass appropriately
Animate player sprite
Hide POIs and other irrelevant info
Spawning pokecenters at certain locations
Flying to other cities

michaelR -- 2018-01-08 12:56
created login template - login and create account forms on same page - CSS still needs to be added
added icon to base.html - all sites now show a pokeball as their icon

kellyW -- 2018-01-08 13:16
added db.py - table for usernames and passwords
added home.html
rerouted and renamed templates

naotakaK -- 2018-01-08 23:46
Added limited info window functionality - for some reason, info windows are spawning in fixed location, not center of map. 
Otherwise, infowindows are ready for integration with PokeAPI. 
Place searches still need to be put in, I have some questions about libraries in the Maps API. Heatmaps : how to start off with nothing in the heatmap and then generate new points, maybe erase old ones?

naotakaK -- 2018-01-11 10:52
FIXED INFO WINDOW PROBLEM!!!
Working on live updating heatmaps through MVC arrays. 
Need to work on making a close enough function to figure out when to open up an infoWindow.
Places search box - how to combine libraries?

naotakaK -- 2018-01-11 18:29
Having weird script error with 'google is not defined'
The script error has something to do with the order that the scripts are declared (I think)
Downloaded favicon and added to static/img

shakilR -- 2018-01-11 21:18
moved heatmap setup in a function to be called with initMap

kellyW -- 2018-01-11 23:30

shakilR -- 2018-01-11 23:59
added logout button

michaelR -- 2018-01-12 12:50
fixed background of login page - used cover size
changed image on login page - png for clear background - may be changed later

kellyW -- 2018-01-16 13:20
update readMe
 
naotakaK -- 2018-01-16 22:19
Encounters are fixed and are waiting for pokeAPI stuff to continue.
- Walking near a heatmap spawns (or has a chance to spawn) an infoWindow with info about Pokemon. 
After player has walked close enough to the heatmap, regardless of whether or not the infoWindow spawned,
the player will not be able to encounter another pokemon in that same exact location.
- One problem with this is that although pokemon will no longer spawn there, the points remain in the heatmap.
This could be solved by using the pkmnLocations as the points for the heatmap and changing the radius, but could be ugly.
- One thing that should probably be implemented is checking if the player walks away from the infoWindow and then close the infoWindow automatically.
- Other things are mostly graphical, we still need to do the spawning points as the player moves around.

kellyW -- 2018-01-17 13:20
added navbar

naotakaK -- 2018-01-17 23:24
Encountering pokemon now deletes point from the heatmap.
Still need to work on auto closing infoWindow based on player distance from the window.

kellyW -- 2018-01-18 13:00
finished navbar
- different based on logged in or logged out
started: encounter window shows a random pokemon

naotakaK -- 2018-01-18 18:49

- Need to do ajax
- heatmaps spawn around player as player moves


naotakaK -- 2018-01-19 14:33
Started ajax stuff
- need to fix infoWindow removal when 2 or more spawn
- need to fix ajax, calling fxn too many times
- fixed permissions for favicon
- downloaded background image and adjusted css accordingly

naotakaK -- 2018-01-19 18:35
ajax still broken
- added running sprite, need to figure out how to change element in DOM

shakilR -- 2018-01-19 20:41
fixed ajax with encounters and closing extra infowindows

naotakaK -- 2018-01-21 01:23
Running player sprite works now
- size needs to be edited to be the same as regular player sprite

naotakaK -- 2018-01-21 11:51
Minor infoWindow fix & commenting

shakilR -- 2018-01-22 16:35
